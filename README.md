# carsonjefferson-github.io
My name is Carson Jefferson.
My email is ccjefferson@my.waketech.edu.
My Github account is set for 2-5 people which would allow multiple clones and branches.
The repository I have created is a starting point of my use for github. I am sure we will see much more of this application.
The steps I took to clone the repository onto my local machine was quite easy, considering all I did was create a new repository, download the github desktop app, click the + icon and select "clone a repository", and finally saved that clone to my school assignments folder in OneDrive.
